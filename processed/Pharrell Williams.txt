Happy Lyrics[Produced by Pharrell Williams]

[Verse 1]
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

[Chorus]
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
[Verse 2]
Here come bad news, talking this and that (Yeah!)
Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back (Yeah!)
Well, I should probably warn ya, I'll be just fine (Yeah!)
No offense to you, don’t waste your time, here's why

[Chorus]
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said
Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said

Freedom Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hold on to me
Don't let me go
Who cares what they see?
Who cares what they know?
Your first name is Free
Last name is Dom
'Cause you still believe
In where we’re from

Man's red flower
It's in every living thing
Mind, use your power
Spirit, use your wings
Freedom!

Hold on to me
Don't let me go
Cheetahs need to eat
Run, antelope
Your first name is King
Last name is Dom
'Cause you still believe
In everyone

[Chorus]
When a baby first breathes
When night sees sunrise
When the whale hops the sea
When man recognizes
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Breathe in

[Verse 3]
We are from heat
The electric one
Does it shock you to see
He left us the sun?
Atoms in the air
Organisms in the sea
The sun and yes, man
Are made of the same things
[Outro]
Freedom!
Freedom!

[Interlude: Kelly Osbourne]
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

Frontin’ Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
I'm looking at you, uh
Sexy, yeah
Look how your ass is so fat
Wanna be again with you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me (I'm sorry baby, so sexy)
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to
How fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on
Never mind if I'm showing off

Unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya
You should stop frontin', babe

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl, I love it, uh

Tell her you gonna call her, ask how it was
And she's gonna love it (Whoa-oh whoa, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Pharrell Williams]
Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told
You threw me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin' what I'm feelin', Denzelin'
Actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are
Stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are
(I was just frontin')

Gust of Wind Lyrics[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
My heart is filled, with love and care
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there
The answer's simple
You lift me up
The view up here, I see all the stars
There go Venus, and there go Mars
Somethin' you been through
You're from above, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
But I didn't know
You s'posed to let it go
[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
With your love, I can board the skies
Riding away that electrified mothership other
Can I stow away? (Can I stow away girl, girl?)
Colourful winds of the northern sky
Is the closest thing, and here is why
Cause we're color
You blow me away (blow me away girl, girl)
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I need it like I breathe it
Music and colors can make one hover
Who cares if they don't see you?
Don't you know that they're the same?
I need it like I breathe it
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer
Who cares if they don't see you?
You gotta tap in and learn the way

[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Pharell Wiliams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it

I didn't let it go
Then I realized I'm trying to fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know, oh
I had to let it go

[Chorus: Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while

Despicable Me Lyrics[Hook]
I'm having a bad, bad, day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see, ugh
Despicable me
I’m having a bad, bad, day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see, ugh
Despicable me

[Verse 1]
Why ask "Why?", better yet, "Why not?"
Why are you marking X on that spot?
Why use a blow torch, isn’t that hot?
Why use a chainsaw, is that all you got?
Why do you like seeing people in shock?
But my question to you is "Why not?"
Why go to the bank and stand in line?
Just use a freeze gun, it saves me time
[Hook]
I'm having a bad, bad, day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see, huh
Despicable me
I’m having a bad, bad, day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see, ugh
Despicable me

[Verse 2]
Why ask "Why?" when this is art?
Why parallel when I could just park?
Why does Vector think that he’s smart?
And does his dad know I know his part?
Why did I have to live with my mom?
Why do you think that I should be calm?
Why want the moon, the World's in my palm?
Is it crazy you think I’ve gone?

[Hook]
I'm having a bad, bad, day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see, huh
Despicable me
I’m having a bad, bad, day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see, ugh
Despicable me

To make you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Haha

Lost Queen Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen
[Verse 1]
I don't have a problem with multi-taskin'
Takin' care of you is my number one passion
Put it before my eyes, you know I'ma smash it
Only if you want it, want it
You don't have to ever think about askin'
I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it
Can I start you up? It's automatic
Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty
Ain't gotta ask me to
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen
[Verse 2]
I don’t have a problem meeting mommy and daddy
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy
Half of me is good, the other half nasty
Can't help it if I want it, want it
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player
And like GEICO, the time I saved 'em
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown
Ain't gotta ask me to
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen

That Girl Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
We do this in our sleep, nigga
Yeah
Ever been in love before?
I wanna holla at you, ma
You know it's hard for a player to admit that sometimes
But I'ma spit that sometimes, y'know what I'm sayin?
Ayy, P, give it to me one time nephew

[Chorus: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
She from around the way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
It wouldn't stay, wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, let me reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl
[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Yes sir, that's her
But it wasn't like that back when I met her
The lavish life from all the dough spun
Before the double R had to hitchhike thumb
Her friends didn't like niggas like us
But I arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed
Spider web sex must have got caught up
But there's more to it I remember once
Sayin' "Let's shit on the peons
Let's go to Vegas and watch Celine Dion"
Make 'em say "What we on?"
You say no like you was doin' it for eons
Fuck it I just hum and let the watch give off the neons
When it rains it pours, I laugh to myself when I change the score
You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more
And somethin' 'bout how your ex was a toy, I guess he played games
It's only diamond dice here not tryin' to justify
But when you shut your eye you can touch the sky
You in trouble ma, and you should pray about speed
But if that's 'bout you, what that say about me?

[Chorus: Pharrell & Snoop Dogg]
What you say, say, say?
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
Check it out, check it out
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, let me reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
See I'm a crip in dark blue Chucks
And I does what I does yeah I might say "cuz"
It's really weird cause a nigga got love
Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood
She told me that her baby daddy was a thug
Now it is what it is and it was not was
I'm hollerin' at lil mama like what
Monday morn stack tryna get my cheese back
All these memories breed seed to the rhythm rhyme pleaser
Lay back while we sippin' on a breezer
Fresh four pack sittin' in the freezer
Ain't that Kadija I heard she was a skeezer
She used to hit them licks wit' the visas
When I seen her wit the homies I was like "Jesus"
It's been a little minute since I seen her
Hope her man don't run up cause I'll have to pull the nina

[Chorus: Pharrell]
There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away, simply run away
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself, or try to reason
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl
[Outro: Pharrell]
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man5Embed

Like God said you would

So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day

Entrepreneur Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
I am black ambition
I am always whisperin'
They keep tellin' me I will not
But my will won't listen
Gravity on a black man
With everything on his back and
His family and passion
If the doors ain't crackin'

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You gotta let go (Let go)
If you want to fly, take the leap
You gotta risk it all (Risk it all)
Or they'll be lots of things you'll never see
You gotta let, let go
'Cause you never know what's in store
Mister entrepreneur
[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
In this position with no choice
A system imprison young black boys
Distract with white noise
The brainwashed become hype boys
Third eye dilate
You wasn't supposed to make it off Sеction Eight
Robbin' Peter just to pay Paul
Preparе to risk everything

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You need let go (Let go)
If you want to fly, take the leap
You gotta risk it all (Risk it all)
Or they'll be lots of things you'll never see
Remember black is space
And its the color of your face
There will be no sunny days
If Black went away

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, lies told to you, through YouTubes and Hulus
Shows with no hues that look like you do
Black Twitter, what's that? When Jack gets paid, do you?
For every one Gucci, support two FUBUs
Sippin' crip-a-Cola consumer and a owner, uh
'Til we all vertically integrated from the floor up
D'Usse pourer, sip Ace 'til I throw up
Like gang signs 'cept I bang mines for both ya
Serial entrepreneur, we on our own
Stop sittin' around waitin' for folks to throw you a bone
If you can't buy the building at least stock the shelf (Word)
Then keep on stackin' 'til you stockin' for yourself, uh
See, everything you place after black
Is too small a term to completely describe the act
Black nation, black builder, black entrepreneur
You in the presence of Black Excellence and I'm on the board

Bad day, at work, crazy boss, crazy hours
Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a sail
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress

When your environment seems to get brighter

I, will do, what I need, 'til every woman on the Earth is free

We just shake our heads, and dance, the moment so surreal
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels

When they were too good and you wanted to shake them, who came?

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
I was your dirty boy, your good, new secret toy
Show me how they get you joy (Who stayed in trouble with you?)
Oh, don't you want some more? Come on, I think they're gone
Our part is coming on (You're either with me or doomed)

[Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
Hug me (Bring it in)
Would you loosen up? Would ya
Hug me (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture
[Verse 2: Trey Parker]
Wake up, you're sleeping on me, playing this stupid game
Why can't we flex on the world and make them say our name

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
Our favorite color's purple, we stay out past the curfew
My kung-fu grip will hurt you (Who stayed in trouble with you?)
You dyed your hair like me, black so everyone can see
Your parents couldn't believe (You're either with me or doomed)

[Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
Hug me (Bring it in)
Would ya loosen up? Would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture

[Bridge: Trey Parker]
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya
Oh would ya, would ya loosen up, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya
Would ya wanna take a picture?
[Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
Hug me (Bring it in)
Would ya loosen up? Would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture
Hug me (Bring it in)
Would ya loosen up? Would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)

Can I Have It Like That Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell]
Ladies and Gentlemen (Oh)
Yes, Sir... let's do it
Yes, Sir... hot... yo

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
On and on and, my nuts I'm palmin'
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly, I'm like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream, "Cheers!"
Get your two-step 'cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, two for a pair
Officially announcing, "This is warfare," 'cause
Back in the day, my clouds was grey
And it seemed liked my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin-ass jets, but now
Man, my vision so clear out the window of the Lear
And I'm talkin' on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now
Hello? Can you hear me now?
[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
On and on and, this beat is on and
I control their mind from straight over the phone
And let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist
And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious (Yes, Sir)
From Louisville to Jimmy Choos, he's real
She know the time, she sees the Richard Mille
Plat-double skeletal, Tourbillion
It's just like her body, move, it turns her on
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See, I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool it like New Edition unless you hot as you say
I get it, okay, let it boil away
But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong
And I got something right for them right after this song
My name is Skate... board... P
Ladies and gentlemen (Oh)
[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
On and on and, the temperature is warm and
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice, bet a hundred that you vomit
And should I mention the fact the Transition is the track?
No incision to the vision just to get me where I’m at, huh
Little Skateboard, he too grown (Come on)
Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two-Tone
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh)
I don't smoke but I bet the sense a mil' of it
Totally intensifies the vivid-ass appeal of it
You can be jealous, and grit your teeth (Uh huh)
But all these little niggas got somethin' in reach
So, you want heat? These niggas can front heat
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseek
My name is Skate... board... P
Ladies and Gentlemen (Oh)
[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)8Embed

Best Friend Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell]
Yeah, yep
Spit my gum out right now, yeah
What up, world?
Got my inspiration in the studio with me tonight, feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about
Talk to y'all niggas
Yessir, hey

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fuckin' therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness?
Pop, there goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine ten years old, full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, "You about what you weep"
She used to help me with my homework, addition, subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip your mind from crying? Better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums?
Look, ooh, you see me, Ma, they wish they could be me, Ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by leukaemia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
'Cause Grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder what kind of black cloud I was under
'Cause fifteen years later, the other died that summer
Bummer
[Chorus: Pharrell]
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversations, it comes out in a line
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Ayo, 1021 Atlantis Drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis Apartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12-year-olds there, they be flashing crack
And when they shoot you, nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Ayo, Didi, Fleet and Marvian, can you imagine that?
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passionate
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise, so many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man, they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well, let me tell you niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breath, a pulse, nigga strive
Divine intervention this is, I heard a voice, nigga, listen to this
[Chorus: Pharrell]
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes (Uh-huh)
Until you in conversations, it comes out in a line
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out (Okay)

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Jesus will arrange it, but Jesus won't change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself, you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate in Sans Script
I.E. we best friends, speak best friend language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless?
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous
'Cause you both on Bape, BBC and chain-less
Also you're Range-less, therefore switch lane-less
Know you brain-less dangerous cause you pull out the stainless
All of a sudden you smart, now you do something heinous
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chain-less, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Your girl with ya man sellin' lane-less, stop
Nigga, rewind and reverse slides three times
Reassess your thinking and trust me, it'll be fine
First, picture your goal, and repeat, "It'll be mine"
Or fuck it, nigga, just keep imagine killin' me, fine
Now you scrunching your face, tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is tangible, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say your name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank
[Chorus: Pharrell]
My best friend told me (What?)
You be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes (Uh-huh)
Until you in conversations, it comes out in a line
So let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)
Let it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out (Okay)

Runnin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summertime in Virginia was a oven (oven)
All the kids eating ice cream with their cousins (cousins)
I was studyin' while you was playing the dozens (dozens)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't

[Refrain 1]
Runnin' from the man (man) runnin' from the badge (badge)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
Runnin' toward our plans (plans) in the judge's hands (hands)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
[Pre-Chorus]
I know they say you crawl 'fore you walk
But in my mind I already jog
If I stand still I cannot get far
They want the Moon, I'm on Mars
[Chorus]
Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'
I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry
Cause I can see the day comin'
Together we'll fight
Oh, but no more runnin'

[Verse 2]
You and I are not different from each other (other)
Shut our eyes, when we slumber I see numbers (numbers)
Black and white, we're computers, I ain't colored (colored)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't

[Refrain 2]
From runnin' to exams (exams) to jobs for a man (man)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
In the law of the land (land) the women were often banned (banned)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
[Pre-Chorus]
I know they say you crawl 'fore you walk
But in my mind I already jog
If I stand still I cannot get far
They want the Moon, I'm on Mars

Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'
I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry
Cause I can see the day comin'
Together we fight
Oh, but no more runnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they say you crawl 'fore you walk
But in my mind I already jog
If I stand still I cannot get far
They want the Moon, I'm on Mars

Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'
I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry
Cause I can see the day comin'
Together we fight
Oh, but no more runnin'5Embed
You Can Do It Too Lyrics[Intro]
Ah, my nigga you can do it too
(turn me up, turn me up)
You can do it too
My nigga you can do it too
You can do it too
You can do it too
(Just tellin you, ya know?)

[Verse 1]
Ay yo
Never in a million years I'll imagine I'll get my thrills
By listening to squeals of the PJ wheels
As we land, I duck down, I stick my head up
My dick is being sucked down by a bitch named What Now
I look in her eyes and her eyes are like an orange star
Look at the reflection of my foreign car, the R & R
I stick my feet out, you know the Bapes that's made of eel
You know the new shits with Nigo face right on the heel
I was in marching band, I was a skateboarder
Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water
Oxymoronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders
You niggas was cool in school, now you niggas take orders
I'm not dissin your job
But now you listen and nod
Some Outer Limits shit, I know this position is odd
Don't gasp for air
You can turn blue
Look, excel nigga
Trust me you can do it too
[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Verse 2]
I know niggas is like, there's no returning when I
Bought that white 5-50
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
Or ordered the Phantom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack rock beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch, but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass
Trust me, I'mma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream while I'm gettin my cream
I'm Coming To America call me Prince Akeem, yessir
It's kinda weird, cause this our dream
Kinda prophetic, you get it
Cause this I've seen
These type of visions, since I was teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed Visine
Laughed with the class, but with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit, and I be rappin' to you
But you can do it too
[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Verse 3]
I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems he has accused
He's really frustrated and that it all he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next thing bang comes out the barrell
And my man they accused sittin' tight up in jail
Ironically close, my man Lou can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck
Wealthy niggas with a conscience, yeah you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read till the day
But still ya high sadity cause you got a little paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature
Never underestimate the-things you do
Read Job verse 2, inhale the "oo", and go
[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Outro: Jamie Cullum]
Don't be afraid to look up the sky

Young Girl Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
(You never, you never listen to me)
(I'm just, I just wanna tell you, something)
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
(That's true, so true)
(You're the only girl I love too, but)
My heart was soakin' and got broken in a young world
(So true, so true, listen)

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I wasn't trying to lead her on
See I didn't want to be alone
But when she smiled she brought me home
So I brought her home
Its not that the feeling of love is gone
Can't expect a college girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
My heart was soakin' and got broken in a young world
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
The single girls are out tonight (Hey, Pharrell)
But you have my word, my heart, my life (Hey, baby)
And I'm not looking around (I'm not looking around)
So why you lookin' down? (What you lookin down for?)
I fucked up a long time ago
See, I should have never let you know
See, I could give a fuck what tabloids say (As the People Magazine)
And crushes hurt both ways
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z]
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
My heart was soakin' and got broken in a young world (Hov)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Hov)
Young girl, so in love with you

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Hov got a young girl, Hov got a young girl (Got a young girl)
Still not quite twenty one
So high strung, such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, "Hi, Miss Thing"
You're nineteen? (Woo)
No, you're lightning in a bottle, I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows
Screams of horror
Classic Stephen King novel
Mama don't think you should take someone so advanced in romance, you should just wait
Papa don't preach, Hov don't bite
Hov been through it, I might mold your life
'Cause I'ma show you right
Proper etiquette, how to hold your knife
Keep it competitive with Oprah's ice
Be like Janet, take control of your life
[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (Young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (Young girl)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z]
Mama, help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(Too young, a little too young)
Young girl, so in love with you
(Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(She's a—) (Too young, a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(She's a—) (Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(She's a—) (Too young, a little too young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(She's a—) (Just a little too young)
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you
